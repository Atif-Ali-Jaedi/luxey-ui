After months of anticipation and user requests, I'm thrilled to announce the arrival of Dark Mode in our UI Library! This long-awaited feature is designed to enhance your development experience and make your applications more user-friendly, especially in low-light environments.

### Why Dark Mode?

Dark Mode isn't just a trendy feature; it offers several practical benefits:

- <HL>Reduced Eye Strain</HL>: Darker interfaces can be gentler on the eyes,
  especially in dimly lit settings or during extended periods of screen time.
- <HL>Improved Battery Life</HL>: On OLED and AMOLED screens, dark themes can
  save energy and extend battery life.
- <HL>Enhanced Focus</HL>: Dark interfaces can help reduce distractions, making
  it easier to concentrate on your work.

### What Took Me So Long?

You might be wondering why it took me so long to roll out this feature. Hereâ€™s a peek behind the scenes:

1. <HL>Comprehensive Design Overhaul</HL>: Implementing Dark Mode isnâ€™t just
   about changing a few colors. It required a thorough review of our entire
   component library to ensure consistency and visual harmony.
2. <HL>User-Centric Approach</HL>: I gathered extensive feedback from our
   community to understand their needs and preferences for Dark Mode. This
   feedback was crucial in guiding our design and development process.
3. <HL>Performance Optimization</HL>: I wanted to ensure that Dark Mode runs
   seamlessly without affecting the performance of your applications. This
   involved rigorous testing and optimization.

### Key Features of Our Dark Mode

- <HL>Seamless Toggle</HL>: Easily switch between Light and Dark Modes with a
  single click or programmatically through our API.
- <HL>Automatic Detection</HL>: Our library can detect system-level dark mode
  settings and adapt accordingly.
- <HL>Customizable Themes</HL>: While our default Dark Mode is sleek and
  polished, you have full control to customize it to match your brandâ€™s
  aesthetics.
- <HL>Consistent Across Components</HL>: From buttons to modals, every component
  has been carefully adapted to provide a cohesive look and feel in Dark Mode.

### How to Get Started

Enabling Dark Mode in your projects is straightforward:

<Steps>
  <Step heading="Update the library">
    Ensure you are using the latest version of our UI Library.
    
    Use this if you're using CDN.
    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/luxeyui@${currentVersion}/dist/all.min.css" />
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/luxeyui@${currentVersion}/dist/all.min.js" defer></script>
    ```
    And, use this if you're installing via npm.
    ```bash 
    npm i luxeyui@latest
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step heading="Enable Dark Mode">
    To enable dark mode, please copy & paste one of these snippet in your `tailwind.config.js` file.
    ```js 
    tailwind.config = { darkMode: "class" } // For CDN
    ```
    ```js
    module.exports = {
      darkMode: "class",
      // ...
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step heading="Customize as Needed">
    Modify your css file to tweak the Dark Mode to suit your design needs. An example given below. Make sure to use `hsla` format and without the parenthesis and `hsla` to customize the colors.
    ```css 
      :root.dark {
      	--base-primary: 188.6 100% 46.7%;
      	--content-4: 0 0% 99.6%;
      }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step heading="Add the toggle functionality">
    Now all you have to do is to make a functionality for toggling dark mode. For example:
    ```html
    <input type="checkbox" id="toggler" class="switch" />
    <script>
      document
    		.querySelector("#toggler")
    		.addEventListener(
    			"click",
    			e =>
    				(document.documentElement.className = e.target.checked
    					? "dark"
    					: "")
    		);
    </script>
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What's Next?

Our commitment to enhancing your development experience doesnâ€™t stop here. I'm already working on new features and improvements based on your feedback. Hereâ€™s what you can expect soon:

- <HL>More Theme Options</HL>: I plan to introduce more predefined themes and
  customization options.
- <HL>Performance Enhancements</HL>: Continued focus on optimizing performance
  across all components.
- <HL>New Components</HL>: Expanding our library with new components and
  utilities to make your development faster and easier.

Thank you for being a part of our journey. I'm excited to see how you will leverage Dark Mode to create stunning and accessible user interfaces.

**Happy Coding!** ðŸŽ‰
