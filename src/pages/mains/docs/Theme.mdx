## What's a Theme?

A theme is web design manages the front-end design, establishing the overall appearance and functionality by managing its front-end design. Themes determine all design components: page layouts, backgrounds, color palettes, headers and footers, positioning, sizing, and typography.

## Usage

After installing the library, you can either use the theme by CSS Variables or TailwindCSS utility classes.

### CSS Variables

I've made it super easy to customize. All you need is 2 `selectors`, `html {}` and `html.dark {}`. The second one is for customizing the theme if you're using dark mode.

```css
.html {
  --base-primary: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;
}
```

The background color of the following component will be `hsl(var(--base-primary))`.

> **Note**: As if you're not using the theme in your `tailwind.config.js`, you must use the theme as following only when you're not using the theme in the components:

```html
<div class="bg-[hsl(var(--base-primary)]">Hello</div>
```

But, if it is a LuxeyUI Component, it looks something like this:

```html
<div class="bg-base-primary">Hello</div>
```

The good thing is that, you don't need to write `bg-base-primary` here, because in a primary button, it was already done.

> **CSS variables must be defined without color space function.** See the <ELink text="Tailwind CSS documentation" link="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#using-css-variables"/> for more information.

### List of Variables

Here is the full list of the variables, use it as your need and especially customization.

<Highlight language="css" code={CSSVariables} />

> **Note**: See the [Colors](/docs/colors) section to learn more about the colors.

### Adding new Colors

To add new colors, you need to add them to your CSS file and to your `tailwind.config.js` file.

```css
:root {
  --custom: 38 92% 50%;
  --custom-foreground: 48 96% 89%;
}
:root.dark {
  --custom: 48 96% 89%;
  --custom-foreground: 38 92% 50%;
}
```

<hr className="border-0" />

```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        warning: "hsl(var(--warning))",
        "warning-foreground": "hsl(var(--warning-foreground))",
      },
    },
  },
};
```

You can now use the `custom` utility class in your components.

```html
<div className="bg-warning text-warning-foreground" />
```

### tailwind.config.js

To use the default theme more efficiently without writing those CSS Variables in your CSS file, copy & paste the following code in your `tailwind.config.js` file.

<Highlight language="js" code={tailwindConfiguration} />

Now you can freely use the utility classes in your `html` like this:

```html
<div class="bg-base-primary rounded-14 hover:scale-97 focus:outline-layout-focus">Hello</div>
```

### Other color formats

I recommend using <ELink text="HSL colors" link="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/07/hsl-colors-css/"/> for theming but you can also use other color formats if you prefer but it'll be a headache to customize.

See the <ELink text="Tailwind CSS documentation" link="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#using-css-variables"/> for more information on using rgb, rgba or hsl colors.
