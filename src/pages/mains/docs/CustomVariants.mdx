# Custom Variants 

LuxeyUI allows you to create new variants for components that better suit your project's needs. This can be done quite easily. 

All you have to do is to add new `selectors` and `properties` in your CSS file for that specific component.

> **Note**: For better understanding the customization process  please visit the [Override Styles](/docs/override-styles) documentation.

## Creating variants for Components 

Let's customize the `Button` component and add a new variant to it. 

### Using Vanilla CSS 

Using Vanilla CSS, it is super simple. Take this for example:

<CodePreview code={`<style>
  button.button {
    /* Colors */
    &.violet {
      background: #8b5cf6;
      color: #fff;
    }
    /* Sizes */
    &.size-xl {
      padding: 0.75em 2em;
    }
  }
</style>
<button class="button violet">Button</button>
<button class="button foreground radius-full size-xl">Button</button>
`}/>

This is just a basic example, you can do a lot more if you know good CSS.

### Using TailwindCSS with PostCSS

Using TailwindCSS, it is the exact same process. But sometimes you might need to use duplicate `selectors` in order to work properly. Below is an example about how to implement that: 

```css
button.button {
  /* Colors */ 
  &.olive {
    @apply text-[#000] bg-[#84cc16];
  }
  &.orange { 
    @apply bg-[#ff8c00] text-[#fff];
  }
  &.violet {
    @apply bg-[#8b5cf6] text-[#fff];
  }
  /* Disabled */
  &[data-disabled] {
    @apply bg-[#eaeaea] text-[#000] opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed;
  }
  /* Sizes */
  &.size-xs {
    @apply px-2 min-w-12 h-6 text-tiny gap-1 rounded-small;
  }
  &.size-md {
    @apply px-4 min-w-20 h-10 text-small gap-2 rounded-lg;
  }
  &.size-xl {
    @apply px-8 min-w-28 h-14 text-large gap-4 rounded-xl;
  }
}
```

Like these, you can add your custom variants within your css file using either Vanilla CSS or TailwindCSS.
