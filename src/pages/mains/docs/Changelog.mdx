# Changelog

All the notable changes are listed here, ranging from super small updates to huge ones.

<Chip>v0.3.3</Chip>
<Time>August 10, 2024</Time>

## Updated Input component Again

I've made some errors in the last update, so I had to release this one. 

 - Added transparent background instead of just solid background, `bg-layout-bg → bg-transparent`.
 - Added a gap between the content before / after the `input`, inside `inner-wrapper`, `gap-px → gap-1.5`.

<Chip>v0.3.2</Chip>
<Time>August 10, 2024</Time>

## Updated Input component

I've done the following things with this component:

 - Adjusted the border width, `2.5px → 2px`
 - Adjusted the radius for `sizes` & `radiuses` 
 - Added the `helper-wrapper`
 - Added the `description` & `error-msg` for `helper-wrapper`
 - Added validation for the input to display error only when needed. 
 - Fixed and issue higher the colours of the borders doesn't appear on focus because of the specificity issue.
