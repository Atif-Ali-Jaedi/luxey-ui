# Accordion

Accordion is a type of menu that displays a list of headers stacked on top of one another. When clicked on, these headers will either reveal or hide associated content.

## Slots

- **accordions**: The list of accordions or the wrapper.
- **accordion**: The actual accordion which has the header
and the body.
- **accordion-header**: The header of the accordion.
- **accordion-body**: The body of the accordion.

> **Note**: The accordion itself hasn't set to work if it has accordions inside it yet.

## Usage

<CodePreview code={accordionCodes.default} />

> **Note**: You have to use that long class `[&:has(...)>...>i]:className` to be able to animate the anchor icon as your desire.

## Expand single items

If you set the `data-selection-mode` to `single`, then only one accordion can be opened at once.

<CodePreview code={accordionCodes.expandSingleItems} />

## Disabled

<CodePreview code={accordionCodes.disabledAccordion} />

## Custom Styles

You can customize the `Accordion` component by passing custom TailwindCSS classes to the component slots.

<CodePreview code={accordionCodes.customized} />
